# Introduction

Dietrich TODO

# Background on Probabril

Oli TODO (Can be mostly copied from p1 I expect)

# The Problem of Reals

Oli TODO (I'm thinking background stuff here.  The headers are dumb, you can merge with the previous section however you want.  Could add some ranty stuff here about how the theory was hard.)

# Implementation

## Interval Analysis Approach

Dietrich TODO

## Polynomial Approach

Oli TODO (I might be using the wrong title for this section)

# Results

Dietrich TODO (I'll also collect the results I can)

# Conclusion

Dietrich TODO (Will be short, depends on results a bit I suppose)
